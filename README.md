# ResearchProject

This is a sample of (some of) the code that I wrote as part of the research project I undertook at the University of California, Irvine, in which I was given the opportunity to work together with a PHD student and Professor of Computer Science in the task of identifying the characteristics in patients that correspond to a high likelihood of being an “ED frequent flyer”- that is, someone who is likely to repeatedly visit emergency hospital services without good cause. I was given the dataset and tasked with finding trends, followed by coming up with ideas to explain the results. This was very exciting for me, as I could have a real impact in using my skills to empower hospital staff and potentially hospital policy makers to combat an ever increasing problem in the United States.

# Running the project

The code is written in (Python) Jupyter notebook, which you can download [here](https://jupyter.org/) to test out the algorithms (on your own datasets)
